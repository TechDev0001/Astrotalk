# Lunar☾

This is my final project for the FooCoding program held in Malmö between February and October 2023. The application I developed focuses on astrology, tarot and numerology with the help of external and internal data simultaneously.

## Technologies

- JSX
- CSS
- React.js
- TypeScript

## Sections

- Home
- About
- Zodiac
- Tarot
- Numerology

## Requirements

- Each week, students need to prove to have understood, learned and implemented new topics
- No external package is allowed other than React and React Router Dom
- The application must fetch data through an API
- The application needs to be fully functional on the deployed version

## Checkpoints

- Inclusion of type-safe components
- Hooks(useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback, useMemo)
- DOM events
- Conditional rendering
- List rendering from API
- react-router-dom(and navigation between at least two pages)
- Deployment
